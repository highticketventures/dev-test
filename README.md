# Application

Unfortunately I have a  serious family emergency and will have to travel to Florida this weekend so I will not be available to complete this task. I have worked on this from 9am Wed 23rd to 4pm Thur 24th, my submission represents about 15 hours of work.

Loom: https://www.loom.com/share/52bad6e058604feeb4706286ab0b297c

## Tech Stack

- **Backend** Express.ts + Sequelize + PostgreSQL
- **Frontend:** Vue3 + TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui
- **Deployment:** Kubernetes
- ~~**Auth:** Clerk (with org support)~~ Skipped due to time
- ~~**Real-time:** Pusher or Ably~~ Skipped due to time
- ~~**Integration:** Linear API~~ Skipped due to time


I deviated heavily from the proposed tech stack. I do not like Next.js, React or TSX/JSX, because of this I have attempted to complete this using the Tech Stack I think is best. I understand this may work against me in this interview process, but I have been building web technology for over a decade and I am confident that the stack I have chosen is the correct one for HTV.

I prefer to take a more traditionalist approach and decouple the front-end and back-end into two separate repos. The backend contains the server-side business logic, models and migrations while the frontend repo contains all of the client side UI. While vibe-coding a next.js project and one-click deploying it to vercel is how all of the cool tech influencers are deploying apps, I belive my approach is still the correct method for building highly scalable multi-million dollar start-ups.

# So You Want to Be Our ***Founding Engineer***? - "Yes"

If you’re reading this, it means your application *impressed us* and now we want to see what you can build.

At High Ticket Ventures, we’re looking for a **world-class founding engineer**—an outlier who’s hungry to own product from day one and help us build the platform from the ground up.

The companies we back will rely on this platform to get critical work done—hiring top talent, accelerating growth, and unlocking capital. We’re building the operating system they’ll run on.

>**Everything you need to succeed is outlined below.** Most candidates lose points simply for not reading. If you follow instructions, check the [FAQs](FAQs.md) before asking questions, and match the design closely—you’re already ahead of 99% of applicants.

Our goal is to stress-test your fullstack and give you an opportunity to show us you can move fast, ship production-grade code, hold your work to the highest standards, and build like a co-founder—without anyone looking over your shoulder.

**The task is simple:** Build a multi-tenant Request Hub.

It’s the foundation of the real HTV platform founders will use every day to request help from our team—whether it's hiring, sales, product, or capital.

If you’re excited to help build the platform that will power 1,000+ companies over the next decade—and want to work on something with uncapped potential from day one—this is your proving ground.

Let’s get started.

---
## What You’re Building

A production-ready Request Hub that demonstrates your ability to:

- Build multi-tenant SaaS architecture from scratch
- Integrate external APIs (like Linear) with clean workflows
- Handle real-time UI updates via webhooks or sockets
- Design polished, responsive interfaces using a modern UI kit
- Think clearly about structure, ownership, and performance

The end product should feel like something that could be shipped to production *today.*

## What It Should Look Like
(_aka: Follow the Damn Design_)

We sweat the details. Our designer put serious craft into a production-ready interface. We’re proud of the work, and we ask that you **respect it** by following it as closely as possible.

You’ll be working off this [**Figma file.**](https://www.figma.com/design/9nHi8AAW02RvGYRWXyQDa0/Dev-Test---Design?node-id=2279-2473&t=h0S7EhFtxjtkfdQ5-1)

✅ Pixel-perfect execution shows you respect the product.  
❌ Loose interpretations, missing states, or lazy styling will hurt your score.

> **Pro Tip:** If something’s unclear or missing, *ask.*

## Tech Stack

These tools mirror what we are looking to use in production:

- **Framework:** Next.js 15+ (App Router)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL + Prisma
- **Auth:** Clerk (with org support)
- **UI Kit:** TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui
- **Real-time:** Pusher or Ably

## What to Deliver

- A **live deployed version** (URL required)
- Working **auth with two companies**
- Request form that creates a **Linear task**
- Real-time updates based on **status changes**
- Admin dashboard with **cross-tenant visibility**
- A 3–5 minute **Loom walkthrough** explaining what you built

### Loom Walkthrough Requirements

Your Loom recording should include:

- How you structured the project (folder layout, key modules)
- How you implemented multi-tenancy and enforced isolation
- How your real-time updates are wired
- One or two code decisions you made that could scale well long-term (e.g. extensible models, clean abstractions)
- Any tradeoffs, shortcuts, or areas where you’d improve given more time
- Anything you added that wasn’t required but felt important to build “the right way”

This is your chance to walk us through how you think and build.

>**Pro Tip:** We welcome initiative! We’re watching how you solve, what you prioritize, and where you go beyond the brief. If you spot a blind spot, plug it. If something feels half-baked, tighten it.

## ⚠️ Before You Ask a Question… 

**Everything you need to succeed** is already in this repo.

That includes the file you're reading and the [FAQs document.](FAQs.md)

Please **study them carefully**—ideally more than once.

>**Pro Tip:** Asking questions that are already answered here **hurts your application**.  
> It shows us you don’t pay attention to detail.

If something is genuinely unclear or missing, you're welcome to ask.  

But we expect you to **search before you ask**—that’s how we operate.
